*************************** IMPORTANT IFORMATION TO FUTURES PROJECTS *********************************

** 'IMPORTANT' **************************************************************************************
*the functions.php does not like comments, comments in functions cause a bug in ACF plugin and in *
*Thumbnails functions also!!  So, avoid to write comments in functions..                          *
*                                                                                                 *
***************************************************************************************************

** 'Create a Blog Page and a Home Page in wordpress editor', after that go to Setting - Reading Settings and
select a static_page : HommePage = Home and PostPage = Blog.
* Create a new page called front-page.php and copy the my frontpage code into it.
* Create index.php or delete its content to be used as blog-page.



** This peace of code make the current page link be selected and all it child.
<?php if(is_page('about-us') || wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID()) == 28) echo 'class="current-menu-item"'?>


**'CREATING POSTS AND STYLING IT..'
In index.php:

<?php the_author_posts_link();?>  Show the author name, I can change it in wordpress editor Users, Your Profine 
and change the Nickname and Display name publicly as ..

<?php echo get_the_category_list('HERE');?>  is a post have a multiple categories, wherever I put in HERE 
will separate the catgories name. ex: , / - 

**'BLOG CONSTRUCTION'

* I used the same layout from page.php

1- Pagination, if I have a lot of posts..  <?php echo paginate_links();?>

2- single.php  is used for a individual posts..
   page.php is used for a individual pages.

3- Author and Category screen should have a diferent php file..
    archive.php is the file that handle this screens.
    * <?php single_cat_title();?>  <!-- get the category name -->
    * <?php echo 'Posts by ' . get_the_author();?>  <!-- get the author name -->
    But I used a new wordprerss function that handle everything for me, category, author name and date..

4- Set in front page the real blog posts dinamic..
    * Using wordpress Custom Query.  
    $homePagePosts = new WP_Query(array(
      'posts_per_page' => 2
      ... there is more in codex site...
    ));

  'IMPORTANT': Right after the ending of while loop using WP_Query, I need to reset the data buffer writing 
  the function <?php wp_reset_postdata();?>

  * set some links to go to blog page using <?php echo site_url('/blog');?>

  ** In Wordpress everything comes in form of pages or posts, page = post_type('page') and post = post_type('post')..


  ** 'GULP' *********************************
  https://github.com/LearnWebCode/Vagrant-lamp
  Installed gulp i root project, but doesn´t work so well when deploy SASS files..

  
  **'CREATING A POST TYPE' *******************

  => To create my Post Types, I will create first a folder (Must Use Plugins) that in wordpress is a special place that user or admin cannot 
  disable by accident, it´s ALWAYS ON. More informations https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins

  By default, in wordpress come just two post type, Posts and Pages.
  But I can create how many I need!!

  1- Inside of wp-content, I create a new folder mu-plugins and inside create a file (name doesn´t mather) that will
  content my post types ..

  I create an EVENT post type in university_post_type.php and from now I can create many more using the same code.


  **'CREATING A CUSTOM FIELDS' *******************

  * To create a custom filed without plugin, I need to write some code in university_post_type.php 
    ex: 'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'excerpt', 'custom-fields'), that give the support to all
    this fields.
  
  * Plugins:
  ACF -> Advanced Custom fields
  CMB2 -> Custom Metaboxes 2



** 'Ordering (Sorting) Custom Queries' *******************

* META in wordpress is allways the extra or a custom additional data associated to a post, to make the Sorting
of events rappen by the date-events, i can use meta_value and to use this I need to create another parameter
called 'meta_key' with the name of the field I want to use  'event_date'.

=> The Upcoming Events need to show only events that WILL HAPPEN, not events from the past.
"CHALLENGE" - 
1-  Need to use to sort only actual events..
'meta_query' => array( 
              array(
                'key' => 'event_date',
                'compare' => '>=',
                'value' => $today
              )
            )



** In archive_event.php I set the event date using the same code as in front-page.

In functions.php I created a new function 'university_adjust_queries($query)' that will handle the event post
archives without create a new WP_Query()..

!is_admin() 'If I am in frontpage not admin'
&& is_post_type_archive('event') 'must be the post type EVENT'
&& $query->is_main_query()) 'if I am really in /event slug'


** 'PAST EVENTS' *******************
* Create a page call page-past-event.php to show all my past events, (event-date != today date)..
* Pagination required a special job in it..



** 'PROGRAMS' *******************
I created in university-post-type.php the post tupe PROGRAMS and some programs like math, biology and english for testing.
As default these programs open in single.php
=> To a single program single-program.php was created
=> To all programs archive-program.php was created


** CREATING RELATIONSHIP between programs and events..
ACF Relationship is not working, there is a bug in the plugin..
Bug fixed, now the relationship is working


** 'PROFESSORS' *******************
I created in university-post-type.php the post tupe PROFESSORS and some professors name for testing.
As default these programs open in single.php then I created 

* Associate a image to all professors..
I uploaded a few images into editor as a thumbnail in respective professors and in my code editor
I get them for eatch one of professors and apply some design to fit the size and a simple animation..

=> I´m goins to work on the recizing of these images..
.. in functions.php i create a code:
    "add_image_size('professorLandscape', 400, 260, true);"
    1- Nickname
    2- pixels wide (width)
    3- pixels tall (height)
    4- true -> crop image
=> Install a Regenerate Thumbnail Plugin to regenerate all images to fit into there new sizes..
=> Install a Plugin to Crop the Images the way I want.. "Manual Image Crop  -  Tomasz Sita "


** Page Banner and Background Image Dynamic *******************
1- Diferent subtitle for eatch page
2- Different image for eatch page.

I created a Custom Field with two fields: Subtitle and Image.
** In location rules (custom field) I used two rules..
a) Post Type - is equal - Post 
            or
a) Post Type - is not equal - Post
This will make that the fields shows in every single post and page..



** 'REDUCING CODE' *******************

 => I created a function caled 'pageBanner()' with codes to provide:
 1- title
 2- subtitle
 3- Background image from internet as an option
 ** I´m also provided a code to set a standard image in case user dont provide an web photo.
 * In general, I have 3 'sources of image', 1- from 'URI', 2- from '/image folder' and 3- from 'wordpress editor ACF'

 'pageBanner($args = NULL)' mens that I can pass a function without any parameter that it won´t crash

Setting the background banner in all pages, the sequence is:
- 'first:' Check if there is an image uri in 'pageBanner()' function.
- 'Second:' Check if there is an image in 'wordpress editor ACF'
- 'Third:' Set the default image in '/images' folder.



** 'Reduce Duplication - "get_template_part()"' *******************

I reduced a repeated code creating a content-event.php file and setting it in:
  1- front-page.php
  2- archive-event.php
  3- page-past-events.php
  4- single.php

    'Both are correct'
    <?php get_template_part('template-parts/content', 'event')?>
    <?php get_template_part('template-parts/content-event')?>

RECICABEL FUNCTION  vs  GET_TEMPLATE_PART()

1- 'RECICABEL FUNCTION' if I want to pass some argument to make it dinamic.
2- 'GET_TEMPLATE_PART()' if I want only avoid duplicated code..



** 'CREATING A GOOGLE MAP IN CAMPUSES' *******************

1- Create the custom field using google MAP
2- Get in google.developers the API KEY to use the map in the website
3- Implement the first code and the 'API Key' in functions.php to able the map in custom field.
4- Set the custom field in eatch campus providing the address.
5- Set the wp_enqueue_script() in functions.php  'university_files()' with all necessary links and the 'API key'.
6- Run 'gulp scripts' to regenerate the functions to handle the Map. (NOT WORKING SO WELL)

In 'university_adjust_queries($query)' from functions.php, the code '$query->set('posts_per_page', -1)' means that
all marks will be seen in the map att once.


** 'LIVE SEARCH RESULT' *******************
Live => Meas real time response with a cuple sugestions..
1- I create a javascript file named Search.js and a class Search.
2- Open and Close search overlay
3-
