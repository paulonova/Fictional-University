*************************** IMPORTANT IFORMATION TO FUTURES PROJECTS *********************************

** 'IMPORTANT' **************************************************************************************
*the functions.php does not like comments, comments in functions cause a bug in ACF plugin and in *
*Thumbnails functions also!!  So, avoid to write comments in functions..                          *
*                                                                                                 *
***************************************************************************************************

** 'Create a Blog Page and a Home Page in wordpress editor', after that go to Setting - Reading Settings and
select a static_page : HommePage = Home and PostPage = Blog.
* Create a new page called front-page.php and copy the my frontpage code into it.
* Create index.php or delete its content to be used as blog-page.



** This peace of code make the current page link be selected and all it child.
<?php if(is_page('about-us') || wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID()) == 28) echo 'class="current-menu-item"'?>


**'CREATING POSTS AND STYLING IT..'
In index.php:

<?php the_author_posts_link();?>  Show the author name, I can change it in wordpress editor Users, Your Profine 
and change the Nickname and Display name publicly as ..

<?php echo get_the_category_list('HERE');?>  is a post have a multiple categories, wherever I put in HERE 
will separate the catgories name. ex: , / - 

**'BLOG CONSTRUCTION'

* I used the same layout from page.php

1- Pagination, if I have a lot of posts..  <?php echo paginate_links();?>

2- single.php  is used for a individual posts..
   page.php is used for a individual pages.

3- Author and Category screen should have a diferent php file..
    archive.php is the file that handle this screens.
    * <?php single_cat_title();?>  <!-- get the category name -->
    * <?php echo 'Posts by ' . get_the_author();?>  <!-- get the author name -->
    But I used a new wordprerss function that handle everything for me, category, author name and date..

4- Set in front page the real blog posts dinamic..
    * Using wordpress Custom Query.  
    $homePagePosts = new WP_Query(array(
      'posts_per_page' => 2
      ... there is more in codex site...
    ));

  'IMPORTANT': Right after the ending of while loop using WP_Query, I need to reset the data buffer writing 
  the function <?php wp_reset_postdata();?>

  * set some links to go to blog page using <?php echo site_url('/blog');?>

  ** In Wordpress everything comes in form of pages or posts, page = post_type('page') and post = post_type('post')..


  ** 'GULP' *********************************
  https://github.com/LearnWebCode/Vagrant-lamp
  Installed gulp i root project, but doesn´t work so well when deploy SASS files..

  
  **'CREATING A POST TYPE' *******************

  => To create my Post Types, I will create first a folder (Must Use Plugins) that in wordpress is a special place that user or admin cannot 
  disable by accident, it´s ALWAYS ON. More informations https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins

  By default, in wordpress come just two post type, Posts and Pages.
  But I can create how many I need!!

  1- Inside of wp-content, I create a new folder mu-plugins and inside create a file (name doesn´t mather) that will
  content my post types ..

  I create an EVENT post type in university_post_type.php and from now I can create many more using the same code.


  **'CREATING A CUSTOM FIELDS' *******************

  * To create a custom filed without plugin, I need to write some code in university_post_type.php 
    ex: 'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'excerpt', 'custom-fields'), that give the support to all
    this fields.
  
  * Plugins:
  ACF -> Advanced Custom fields
  CMB2 -> Custom Metaboxes 2



** 'Ordering (Sorting) Custom Queries' *******************

* META in wordpress is allways the extra or a custom additional data associated to a post, to make the Sorting
of events rappen by the date-events, i can use meta_value and to use this I need to create another parameter
called 'meta_key' with the name of the field I want to use  'event_date'.

=> The Upcoming Events need to show only events that WILL HAPPEN, not events from the past.
"CHALLENGE" - 
1-  Need to use to sort only actual events..
'meta_query' => array( 
              array(
                'key' => 'event_date',
                'compare' => '>=',
                'value' => $today
              )
            )



** In archive_event.php I set the event date using the same code as in front-page.

In functions.php I created a new function 'university_adjust_queries($query)' that will handle the event post
archives without create a new WP_Query()..

!is_admin() 'If I am in frontpage not admin'
&& is_post_type_archive('event') 'must be the post type EVENT'
&& $query->is_main_query()) 'if I am really in /event slug'


** 'PAST EVENTS' *******************
* Create a page call page-past-event.php to show all my past events, (event-date != today date)..
* Pagination required a special job in it..



** 'PROGRAMS' *******************
I created in university-post-type.php the post tupe PROGRAMS and some programs like math, biology and english for testing.
As default these programs open in single.php
=> To a single program single-program.php was created
=> To all programs archive-program.php was created


** CREATING RELATIONSHIP between programs and events..
ACF Relationship is not working, there is a bug in the plugin..
Bug fixed, now the relationship is working


** 'PROFESSORS' *******************
I created in university-post-type.php the post tupe PROFESSORS and some professors name for testing.
As default these programs open in single.php then I created 

* Associate a image to all professors..
I uploaded a few images into editor as a thumbnail in respective professors and in my code editor
I get them for eatch one of professors and apply some design to fit the size and a simple animation..

=> I´m goins to work on the recizing of these images..
.. in functions.php i create a code:
    "add_image_size('professorLandscape', 400, 260, true);"
    1- Nickname
    2- pixels wide (width)
    3- pixels tall (height)
    4- true -> crop image
=> Install a Regenerate Thumbnail Plugin to regenerate all images to fit into there new sizes..
=> Install a Plugin to Crop the Images the way I want.. "Manual Image Crop  -  Tomasz Sita "


** Page Banner and Background Image Dynamic *******************
1- Diferent subtitle for eatch page
2- Different image for eatch page.

I created a Custom Field with two fields: Subtitle and Image.
** In location rules (custom field) I used two rules..
a) Post Type - is equal - Post 
            or
a) Post Type - is not equal - Post
This will make that the fields shows in every single post and page..



** 'REDUCING CODE' *******************

 => I created a function caled 'pageBanner()' with codes to provide:
 1- title
 2- subtitle
 3- Background image from internet as an option
 ** I´m also provided a code to set a standard image in case user dont provide an web photo.
 * In general, I have 3 'sources of image', 1- from 'URI', 2- from '/image folder' and 3- from 'wordpress editor ACF'

 'pageBanner($args = NULL)' mens that I can pass a function without any parameter that it won´t crash

Setting the background banner in all pages, the sequence is:
- 'first:' Check if there is an image uri in 'pageBanner()' function.
- 'Second:' Check if there is an image in 'wordpress editor ACF'
- 'Third:' Set the default image in '/images' folder.



** 'Reduce Duplication - "get_template_part()"' *******************

I reduced a repeated code creating a content-event.php file and setting it in:
  1- front-page.php
  2- archive-event.php
  3- page-past-events.php
  4- single.php

    'Both are correct'
    <?php get_template_part('template-parts/content', 'event')?>
    <?php get_template_part('template-parts/content-event')?>

RECICABEL FUNCTION  vs  GET_TEMPLATE_PART()

1- 'RECICABEL FUNCTION' if I want to pass some argument to make it dinamic.
2- 'GET_TEMPLATE_PART()' if I want only avoid duplicated code..



** 'CREATING A GOOGLE MAP IN CAMPUSES' *******************

1- Create the custom field using google MAP
2- Get in google.developers the API KEY to use the map in the website
3- Implement the first code and the 'API Key' in functions.php to able the map in custom field.
4- Set the custom field in eatch campus providing the address.
5- Set the wp_enqueue_script() in functions.php  'university_files()' with all necessary links and the 'API key'.
6- Run 'gulp scripts' to regenerate the functions to handle the Map. (NOT WORKING SO WELL)

In 'university_adjust_queries($query)' from functions.php, the code '$query->set('posts_per_page', -1)' means that
all marks will be seen in the map att once.


** 'LIVE SEARCH RESULT' *******************

Live => Meas real time response with a cuple sugestions..
1- I create a javascript file named Search.js and a class Search.
2- Open and Close search overlay using 'jQuery'
3- Disable the scroll when overlay and able again when close overlay
4- Shortcut to open and close overlay - 's' to search and 'esc' to close
5- I created a function 'keyPressDispatcher(event)' and inside I get the KeyCode from 
the letter s and asc. (83 and 27) and then use it to open and close the oveerlay..

obs: 'keyup' -> fires just once when I leave the button and 
     'keydown' fires continium until I press the buttom, stops only when I release the btn.

in 'keyPressDispatcher()' function in Search.js this condition:
      
    if (event.keyCode == 83 && !this.isOverlayOpen && !$('input, textarea').is(':focus'))
means:
1. the key is 'S'
2. If the overlay is not open
3. I can press esc when I´m in any other input or textarea field the it will not close the overlay..


** 'Load WP Content with JS' *******************

=> http://localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts shows me a list of post objects in JSON format.
=> http://localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/?search= is the URL used to search inside the post..
**/post can be /page or something else..

I used jQuery to handle 'Wordpress Rest API'
                           'The URL'                                   'Function I want to run after'
    $.getJSON('http://localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/?search=' + this.searchField.val(), (posts)=>{
      alert(posts[0].title.rendered);
    });
  }

'IMPORTANT' => I can generate HTML between javascript using `<h2>something here ${insert something here}</h2>` 
I Generate HTML Based on JSON

"GET URL ROOT IN JAVASCRIPT"
In order to make the url more dinamic, I create in functions.php In 'university_files()' set:
**ps: Function need to be in the bottom...

    wp_localize_script('main-university-js', 'universityData', array(
        'root_url' => get_site_url()
      ));


. 'main-university-js' => Means, the name of the javascript file i use to be flexible (scripts-bundled.js)
. 'universityData' => Means, a variable name (name does not matter).
. 'array()' => array of data that I want to be available in Javascript..


** 'Fixing some details in search function' *******************

1- Move the overlay html code from the footer to Search.js
2- Set search timer for 750 miliseconds.
3- setTimeout(() => this.searchField.focus(), 301);  make the cursor work when I start the search..
4- Create another jquery getJSON to search into pages.. (Synchronous)



** 'Creating ASYNCHRONOUS request' *************************

Create a '$when()' function that will runs any JSON requests..
'.then((posts, pages) => {})' arrays that contains the request results to be used by javascript.


Insert 'authorName' field in JSON using wordpress code in functions.php and then use it in search functions
to display the name of the author..

**************************************************************************************
** 'REST API: Add New Custom Route (URL)' ********************************************
**************************************************************************************

Why Create a new REST API URL:
1- I can create my own Custom Search Logic
2- Respond with less JSON data (load faster)
3- Send only 1 getJSON request instead of 6 in our JS.
4- Perfect exercising for sharpening PHP skills.

in search-rout.php I create a function that runs register_rest_rout('name space/version', 'rout', array());

ex: http://localhost:3000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts
'name space' = wp/v2
'rout' = posts  (whatever comes in the end)
array(                   '*describe what rappen when someone visit this url'
  GET,
  FUNCTION               'that will handle the Json response..'
)


** Search Logic That's Aware of Relationships ************************************

I create a new WP_Query and a while loop to search to professors..


** 'TO AVOID DUPLICATED RESULTS':
$results['professors'] = array_values(array_unique($results['professors'], SORT_REGULAR));
'array_values' Return all the values of an array (not the keys)
'array_unique' removes duplicate values from an array
'SORT_REGULAR' Compare items normally

PS: In search function, I want to include the content only fron Posts and Pages, nothing else, for that,
I will need to create another Custom Field that will contain the contents from programs, professor etc..

***********************************************************************************************************
***********************************************************************************************************
****************************************** FINISH *********************************************************
***********************************************************************************************************


EXTRA:

** 'TRADITIONAL WORDPRESS SEARCHING' *******************

Create a new page in editor named Search and a php file named page-search.php 
Create a form that will use 'action="<?php echo esc_url(site_url('/')); ?>"' to redirect the browse to the root site http://localhost:3000/
It is a way to make the browse use the traditional search http://localhost:3000/?s=textToSearch and display the results in search.php file

Extra file for FORM:

New file searchform.php (name is important) and use the function '<?php get_search_form()?>' and wordpress will get the form for me.


** 'USER ROLES AND PERMISSIONS' *************************

1- Create a newe User Account.

*Subscriber:    'Can do nothing, only manage own profile'
*Contributor:   'Can create a page and post but can´t publish it to world wide.'
*Author:        'Able to create a assign own posts and publish it online. cannot change others content'
*Editor:        'Can change others publishings and contents, even edit and delete posts and pages'
*Administtrator:'Full complete access to do everithing'

I can create a new 'Custom Role' installing a plugin 'Members' By Justin Tadlock.

Now I can add a role to the new user, but first I need to create a permission in the place that I created the 'Post Types',
the university-post-types.php using:

'capability_type' => 'event',
'map_meta_cap' => true,

This code will provide make available the permissions to the Event Post Type.


** 'OPEN REGISTRATIONS' *************************

In General Settings set up the "anyone can register"  and specify the role to 'Subscriber'.
In the browser, write after the homepage url '/wp-signup.php' and sign a new member..

'Redirect Function' **
->  wp_redirect(site_url('/')); ->  Handle the redirection of all users with role 'subscriber' out from AdminPage onto homepage..
Code is in functions.php

** 'Hide Admin Bar from users' ***********************
-> show_admin_bar(false);  Hide the AdminBar from all users with role 'subscriber' and show to Administrators.



***********************************************************************************************************
******************************** CREATE NOTES *************************************************************

1- Create a new page call My Notes (my-notes)
2- Create a file call page-my-notes.php to handle the page.
3- Create a Post Type in university-post-types.php
4- Set 'subscriber' roles to access the Note.
