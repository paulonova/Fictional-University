*************************** IMPORTANT IFORMATION TO FUTURES PROJECTS *********************************

** Create a Blog Page and a Home Page in wordpress editor, after that go to Setting - Reading Settings and
select a static_page : HommePage = Home and PostPage = Blog.
* Create a new page called front-page.php and copy the my frontpage code into it.
* Create index.php or delete its content to be used as blog-page.



** This peace of code make the current page link be selected and all it child.
<?php if(is_page('about-us') || wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID()) == 28) echo 'class="current-menu-item"'?>


**CREATING POSTS AND STYLING IT..
In index.php:

<?php the_author_posts_link();?>  Show the author name, I can change it in wordpress editor Users, Your Profine 
and change the Nickname and Display name publicly as ..

<?php echo get_the_category_list('HERE');?>  is a post have a multiple categories, wherever I put in HERE 
will separate the catgories name. ex: , / - 

**BLOG CONSTRUCTION

* I used the same layout from page.php

1- Pagination, if I have a lot of posts..  <?php echo paginate_links();?>

2- single.php  is used for a individual posts..
   page.php is used for a individual pages.

3- Author and Category screen should have a diferent php file..
    archive.php is the file that handle this screens.
    * <?php single_cat_title();?>  <!-- get the category name -->
    * <?php echo 'Posts by ' . get_the_author();?>  <!-- get the author name -->
    But I used a new wordprerss function that handle everything for me, category, author name and date..

4- Set in front page the real blog posts dinamic..
    * Using wordpress Custom Query.  
    $homePagePosts = new WP_Query(array(
      'posts_per_page' => 2
      ... there is more in codex site...
    ));

  IMPORTANT: Right after the ending of while loop using WP_Query, I need to reset the data buffer writing 
  the function <?php wp_reset_postdata();?>

  * set some links to go to blog page using <?php echo site_url('/blog');?>

  ** In Wordpress everything comes in form of pages or posts, page = post_type('page') and post = post_type('post')..


  ** GULP *********************************
  https://github.com/LearnWebCode/Vagrant-lamp
  Installed gulp i root project, but doesn´t work so well when deploy SASS files..

  
  **CREATING A POST TYPE *******************

  => To create my Post Types, I will create first a folder (Must Use Plugins) that in wordpress is a special place that user or admin cannot 
  disable by accident, it´s ALWAYS ON. More informations https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins

  By default, in wordpress come just two post type, Posts and Pages.
  But I can create how many I need!!

  1- Inside of wp-content, I create a new folder mu-plugins and inside create a file (name doesn´t mather) that will
  content my post types ..

  I create an EVENT post type in university_post_type.php and now on I can create many more using the same code.


  **CREATING A CUSTOM FIELDS *******************

  * To create a custom filed without plugin, I need to write some code in university_post_type.php 
    ex: 'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'excerpt', 'custom-fields'), that give the support to all
    this fields.
  
  * Plugins:
  ACF -> Advanced Custom fields
  CMB2 -> Custom Metaboxes 2



** Ordering (Sorting) Custom Queries *******************

* META in wordpress is allways the extra or a custom additional data associated to a post, to make the Sorting
of events rappen by the date-events, i can use meta_value and to use this I need to create another parameter
called 'meta_key' with the name of the field I want to use  'event_date'.

=> The Upcoming Events need to show only events that WILL HAPPEN, not events from the past.
"CHALLENGE" - 
1-  Need to use to sort only actual events..
'meta_query' => array( 
              array(
                'key' => 'event_date',
                'compare' => '>=',
                'value' => $today
              )
            )



** In archive_event.php I set the event date using the same code as in front-page.

In functions.php I created a new function 'university_adjust_queries($query)' that will handle the event post
archives without create a new WP_Query()..

!is_admin() 'If I am in frontpage not admin'
&& is_post_type_archive('event') 'must be the post type EVENT'
&& $query->is_main_query()) 'if I am really in /event slug'


** PAST EVENTS *******************
