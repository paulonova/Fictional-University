*************************** IMPORTANT IFORMATION TO FUTURES PROJECTS *********************************

** Create a Blog Page and a Home Page in wordpress editor, after that go to Setting - Reading Settings and
select a static_page : HommePage = Home and PostPage = Blog.
* Create a new page called front-page.php and copy the my frontpage code into it.
* Create index.php or delete its content to be used as blog-page.



** This peace of code make the current page link be selected and all it child.
<?php if(is_page('about-us') || wp_get_post_parent_id(get_the_ID()) == 28) echo 'class="current-menu-item"'?>


**CREATING POSTS AND STYLING IT..
In index.php:

<?php the_author_posts_link();?>  Show the author name, I can change it in wordpress editor Users, Your Profine 
and change the Nickname and Display name publicly as ..

<?php echo get_the_category_list('HERE');?>  is a post have a multiple categories, wherever I put in HERE 
will separate the catgories name. ex: , / - 

**BLOG CONSTRUCTION

* I used the same layout from page.php

1- Pagination, if I have a lot of posts..  <?php echo paginate_links();?>

2- single.php  is used for a individual posts..
   page.php is used for a individual pages.

3- Author and Category screen should have a diferent php file..
    archive.php is the file that handle this screens.
    * <?php single_cat_title();?>  <!-- get the category name -->
    * <?php echo 'Posts by ' . get_the_author();?>  <!-- get the author name -->
    But I used a new wordprerss function that handle everything for me, category, author name and date..

4- Set in front page the real blog posts dinamic..
    * Using wordpress Custom Query.  
    $homePagePosts = new WP_Query(array(
      'posts_per_page' => 2
      ... there is more in codex site...
    ));

  IMPORTANT: Right after the ending of while loop using WP_Query, I need to reset the data buffer writing 
  the function <?php wp_reset_postdata();?>

  * set some links to go to blog page using <?php echo site_url('/blog');?>

  ** In Wordpress everything comes in form of pages or posts, page = post_type('page') and post = post_type('post')..
