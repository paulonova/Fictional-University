// If you're using Local by Flywheel you will
// want your settings to be similar to the examples below:

exports.themeLocation = './app/public/wp-content/themes/international-university-theme/';
exports.urlToPreview = 'http://international-university.local/';

// Simply remove the two slashes at the front of those lines
// to uncomment them and then delete lines #1 and #2.

// Be SURE to update urlToPreview to YOUR domain and not mine.
// Be SURE to update themeLocation to YOUR theme folder name
